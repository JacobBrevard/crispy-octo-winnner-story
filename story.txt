I went to the packer game and had a blast. I met Aaron Rodgers and he signed jersey. The packers are the best football team in the league!!!


I was so excited so then I went to a grocery store and buy 500lb candys for people I met.

Then all the people loved me so much so we all ran to the grand canyon. I felt
Very confident in my abilities so I tight roped walke all the way across it 
with no harness... After that we went to climb to the top of mount everest. This was a challenging task.
