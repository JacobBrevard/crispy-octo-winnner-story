<<<<<<< HEAD
This one time, at band camp, I licked the back of a frog.  I don't remember quite what happened afterwards though.  However, I do remember quite a few fractals, some funny colors, and the world started to melt around me.

Jacob Brevard:
I went to the packer game and had a blast. I met Aaron Rodgers and he signed jersey. The packers are the best football team in the league!!!


Ruizhe Wang: Sep.29 2019 Good Story!


I was so excited so then I went to a grocery store and buy 500lb candys for people I met.

Then all the people loved me so much so we all ran to the grand canyon. I felt
Very confident in my abilities so I tight roped walke all the way across it 
with no harness... After that we went to climb to the top of mount everest. This was a challenging task.


Evan: Does anyone know why this file has a bunch of chevrons, says "HEAD", and has a bunch of strings of hexadecimal charactors in it?

Jacob Brevard: I have no idea. I got rid of them though so hopefully my final commit will take care of that. Now, Back to the end of the story. After traveling to the grand canyon I found myself wondering if the earth was flat or round. So I traveled the world searching for the end which never came... La Fin...
