Jacob Brevard:
I went to the packer game and had a blast. I met Aaron Rodgers and he signed jersey
The packers are the best football team in the league!!!

Charlie Stock:
Unfortunately Aaron Rodgers broke his leg in that game and he is the only player that's valuable in their franchise. Because of this they were demoted to a minor league team!
